# Activation Function 
Activation functions are an essential component of neural networks and play a crucial role in determining the output of each neuron in the network. In computer vision, activation functions are used to convert the weighted sum of input values into a non-linear output, which can be interpreted as the activation level of the neuron.

## Types of Activation Function
There are several activation functions used in computer vision, including the sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), Leaky ReLU, and Softmax. Each of these functions has unique properties that make them suitable for different types of computer vision applications.

### ReLU
ReLU is a widely used activation function in deep neural networks. It is a simple function that returns the input value if it is positive, and 0 if it is negative. The ReLU function is particularly effective in computer vision applications where the input values are usually positive. It has been shown to outperform sigmoid functions in terms of accuracy and convergence speed.

### Leaky ReLu
Leaky ReLU is a variation of the ReLU function that addresses its limitation of outputting 0 for negative input values. Leaky ReLU allows for a small non-zero output for negative input values, which can help prevent the problem of "dying ReLU" where a large number of neurons output 0 and become useless during training.

### Softmax
The Softmax function is a popular activation function used in the final layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It normalizes the output values to a probability distribution, making it ideal for problems where the output should represent the probability of each class.

### Sigmoid
The sigmoid function is a classic activation function that was widely used in early neural networks. It is a non-linear function that maps any input value to a range between 0 and 1. The sigmoid function is useful for binary classification problems, such as object recognition in images where the output should be either 0 or 1. However, sigmoid functions can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients of the function become very small as the input values become large or small. This can result in slow training and poor performance.

### TanH
The tanh (hyperbolic tangent) function is another non-linear function that maps any input value to a range between -1 and 1. The tanh function is useful for problems where the input values can be negative or positive. Like the sigmoid function, the tanh function can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. However, it is a popular choice for hidden layers in neural networks because it is zero-centered, meaning that it can reduce the correlation between adjacent layers in the network.

### Vanishing Gradient Problem
The vanishing gradient problem is a common issue that can occur during training of neural networks, particularly those with many layers. It happens when the gradients of the activation function used in the network become very small, close to zero, as the network gets deeper. This can make it difficult for the network to update the weights of the earlier layers, resulting in slow training and poor performance.

#### Problem
The problem occurs because the gradients of the activation function are used to update the weights of the network during backpropagation. When the gradients become very small, the updates to the weights become very small as well, and the network can become stuck in a suboptimal solution. This problem is more pronounced with activation functions like the sigmoid and tanh functions, which have small gradients in regions where the activation values are close to their extremes (i.e., close to 0 or 1 for sigmoid, and close to -1 or 1 for tanh).

#### Consequence
One consequence of the vanishing gradient problem is that deeper neural networks can be harder to train than shallower networks. This is because the gradients of the activation function can become exponentially small as the network gets deeper, making it difficult to update the weights of the early layers. Researchers have proposed several methods to alleviate this problem, including the use of alternative activation functions like ReLU, initialization techniques like He initialization, and optimization techniques like batch normalization.

#### Alternetives
In summary, the vanishing gradient problem is a common issue in deep neural networks, which can make it difficult to update the weights of the network during training. This can result in slow training and poor performance. Understanding this problem and applying appropriate techniques to alleviate it is an important consideration when designing and training deep neural networks.





# Conclusion 
n conclusion, activation functions play a critical role in computer vision applications. They are responsible for introducing non-linearity in the neural network, making it possible to learn complex relationships between input and output. Different activation functions have unique properties that make them suitable for specific types of computer vision applications. Therefore, selecting the appropriate activation function is essential to achieve optimal performance in computer vision tasks.
